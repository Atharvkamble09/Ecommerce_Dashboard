# Ecommerce_Dashboard
Visualisation about sales
1) A tracking and analysis tool for online sales data was developed.
2) Customised the worksheet by utilising filters and slicers to dive down into complex parameters.
3) Developed connections, joined new tables, performed computations to alter data, and enabled user-driven parameters for visualisations.
4) Made use of a variety of tailored visualisations, including slicers, a map, a bar chart, a pie chart, a donut chart, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, and line charts.
